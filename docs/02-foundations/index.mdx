# Foundations

This section covers the foundational concepts you need to understand when working with Large Language Models and the Go AI SDK.

## Topics

- **[Overview](./01-overview.mdx)** - Learn about foundational concepts around AI and LLMs.

- **[Providers and Models](./02-providers-and-models.mdx)** - Learn about the providers and models that you can use with the Go AI SDK.
