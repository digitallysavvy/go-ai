# Advanced

This section covers advanced topics and concepts for the Go AI SDK. Working with LLMs often requires a different mental model compared to traditional software development, and Go's concurrency primitives provide powerful patterns for building production-ready AI applications.

After reading these topics, you should have a better understanding of the paradigms behind the Go AI SDK and how to use them to build robust, scalable AI applications.

## Topics

- **[Prompt Engineering](./01-prompt-engineering.mdx)** - Learn advanced techniques for crafting effective prompts.

- **[Backpressure](./03-backpressure.mdx)** - Learn how the SDK handles backpressure and cancellation with Go channels and contexts.

- **[Caching](./04-caching.mdx)** - Learn how to implement caching strategies to optimize performance and reduce costs.

- **[Rate Limiting](./06-rate-limiting.mdx)** - Learn how to implement rate limiting for production deployments.

- **[Model as Router](./08-model-as-router.mdx)** - Learn how to use a language model as an intelligent router to select the best tool or model for each request.

- **[Sequential Generations](./09-sequential-generations.mdx)** - Learn how to chain multiple AI generations together for complex workflows.

## Key Concepts

### Concurrency and Control Flow

Go's goroutines, channels, and contexts provide natural patterns for managing AI workloads:
- **Channels** provide automatic backpressure for streaming responses
- **Contexts** enable clean cancellation and timeout handling
- **Select statements** allow responsive concurrent operations

### Production Patterns

Building production AI applications requires:
- Robust error handling and retry logic
- Caching to reduce latency and costs
- Rate limiting to prevent quota exhaustion
- Monitoring and observability
